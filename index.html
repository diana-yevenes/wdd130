        <p>The Obelisco, symbol of the City of Buenos Aires, was built in 1936 to commemorate the 400 years of the first
            foundation
            of the city. The construction of the Obelisk, on a design by architect Alberto Prebisch, started on March
            20th, 1936, on the same
            spot where the National Flag was raised for the first time in the city in 1812. It was inaugurated on May
            23rd the same
            year. It has been declared as a national historic monument.</p>
